# *Save Qualified Loans as New CSV*

**This project is a new feature which will be added to the our existing loan qualifier app. The new feature will allow users who would like to save their list of qualified loaners as a csv file. The main problem which has inspired us to add this feature is the lack of a save csv functionality, which makes it difficult for the user to access their list of qualified loaners, which they meet the criteria for.**
